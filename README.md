# Motif

Motif combines a real-time audio engine with a vim-style command system — every action is a named command, keybindings are remappable data, and the UI is navigated entirely via keyboard. It aims to be a lightweight, modular, and extensible DAW for the post-modern era.

**This project is very early.** The audio engine and a simple synth are taking shape, but there is no UI, no file I/O, and no plugin support yet.
